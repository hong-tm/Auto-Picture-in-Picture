## üåü **YouTube and Bilibili Auto Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Userscript**

> **Currently Only Compatible with Chrome and Brave! Edge is Not Supported**

I created this userscript with the help of AI to automatically trigger Picture-in-Picture (PiP) mode while watching YouTube and Bilibili videos. It handles tab switching and video playback status changes, providing a seamless video-watching experience. It took some time, but I achieved the best results and really enjoyed the previous experience on the Arc browser. Maintenance may be sporadic since it‚Äôs AI-assisted.

üéâ **Enjoy the smoothest PiP experience available!**

## üåü Key Features:

### 1. **Automatic PiP Mode Activation**
- üîÑ PiP mode is automatically triggered when the video plays, allowing you to watch the video in a floating window while performing other tasks or browsing other pages.
- ‚ö° If the tab is switched and the video is still playing, PiP will wait for user interaction to trigger.

### 2. **Prevents PiP Trigger on Pause**
- ‚ùå When the pause button is clicked, PiP mode will not be automatically triggered, preventing accidental entry into PiP mode.

### 3. **Tab Switching Handling**
- üîÑ When switching back to the tab with the video, PiP will remain in standby mode and will only activate when the user clicks on the video.

### 4. **Video Click Event**
- üé¨ When the user clicks the video, PiP mode will be triggered if the video is playing.

### 5. **Supports Media Session API** (Chrome 120 and above)
- üì± The `navigator.mediaSession` API is used to set the "Enter PiP" action, allowing users to control PiP via media sessions.

### 6. **Bypass User Interaction Requirement**
- ‚úÖ Unlike other scripts that might be limited by browser security restrictions, this script doesn't require user interaction (like clicking on the page) to activate PiP mode.
